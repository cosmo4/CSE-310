# CSE 310 - Module Report

Name: Luke Warner

## Part 1 - Module Planning

This section should be filled on the first Monday of the Sprint and submitted

### Section 1.1 - Module Selection

1. What Sprint is this for (1-5)? 4

2. Select the Module (with a single X) that you will do this Sprint:

|Module                   |Selected Module|
|-------------------------|---------------|
|Cloud Databases          |               |
|Data Analysis            |       X       |
|Game Framework           |               |
|GIS Mapping              |               |
|Mobile App               |               |
|Networking               |               |
|SQL Relational Databases |               |
|Web Apps                 |               |
|C++                      |               |
|Java                     |               |
|Kotlin                   |               |
|Erlang                   |               |
|TypeScript               |               |
|Rust                     |               |
|Choose Your Own Adventure|               |

3. Find the list of unique requirements for your selected module in the Module Summary in Canvas.  In some circumstances, you will need to modify the requirements based on the technology or language you selected.  For the Choose Your Own Adventure, you need to create your own requirements.  List the unique module requirements below:

Write software to analyze a set of data to answer two questions about that data as detailed below:
Find a free dataset that interests you.

* Identify the two questions about the dataset on your own. You might change your questions after you explore the data further.

* Write a program in any programming language using a statistics library (e.g. R or Python Pandas) to analyze the dataset and provide an answer to your questions.

* You must demonstrate the ability to do one or more of the following to achieve each answer: filter, sort, aggregate (sum, average, count), or data conversion.

You can also use this module to explore Machine Learning. You will need to propose a project different requirements in your project plan.

Stretch Challenges (select one):

Update your software so it draws a graph showing some of the results.

Identify a third question from your dataset and write code to answer it.

### Section 1.2 - Planning

During the Sprint, you will spend 4 hours in class meetings, 4 hours on your team project (2 of which during class), and 10 hours on your selected module.  Make a plan for your 10 hours by answering the questions below.  You should refer back to this plan and make adjustments during the Sprint.

1. What sources have you selected to learn the technical material?

[Getting started with Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/getting_started/intro_tutorials/index.html)
[Using Pandas with Titanic Dataset](https://towardsdatascience.com/getting-started-to-data-analysis-with-python-pandas-with-titanic-dataset-a195ab043c77)
[How to Create Inventory Management System with Database in Python: Youtube Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxLuAz7b1tU&list=PL4P8sY6zvjk6ef4lpm6XiwJVRahLCp6DI)
[Python Pandas Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmorAWRsCAw&list=PLeo1K3hjS3uuASpe-1LjfG5f14Bnozjwy)

2. What is your plan to practice the new material?  In other words, what is the order in which you plan to learn the material before working on your demonstration software?

I will focus on the articles and tutorials listed above for the first 5 hours of the sprint. I want to learn the software better before I try and make anything. 

3. What demonstration software do you plan on submitting at the end of the Sprint (note that this can and may change)?

I'm not really sure what interface Pandas will create, but from the looks of the tutorials I quickly found, it appears to be a desktop app.

4. Identify the days, times, and locations that you will work on the module.

Because my goal this sprint is to do something every week day for my project, I will work on my module right after class at home on MWF and in between my classes on TTH for at least an hour.

5. Identify both a technical risk and a behavioral risk that you antcipate may occur during this Sprint.  What is your mitgigation plan?

I might have problems getting a working GUI, so I may just have to run something in the terminal. Using Pandas is brand new for me so it is important that I take a lot of time learning about it.

## Part 2 - Time Log

This section should be filled out during the Sprint. 

Record all CSE 310 work that you do on your individual module or the team project.  Include time learning, practicing, developing, testing, and documenting.  Don't include time spent in the 4 class meetings (Planning, Stand-Up, Team Review, and Individual Review).  You will need to sum of these hours at the end of the Sprint. Note that the hours you report will affect your grades.

Note that `IM` stands for Individual Module and `TP` stands for Team Project.  

|Date      |Start Time|IM or TP|Description                                 |Hours:Minutes|
|----------|----------|--------|--------------------------------------------|-------------|
|   6/10   |   5:30   |   IM   |  Getting started with pandas, installing   |    2:45     |
|   6/12   |   7:00   |   TP   |Finished uploading feature, creates new note|    3:20     |
|   6/19   |   5:00   |   IM   |Dataset cleaned, learning methods of Pandas |    6:30     |
|   6/20   |   11:00  |   IM   |Finished program tranfering laptop to test  |    1:15     |
|          |          |        |                                            |             |
|          |          |        |                                            |             |

_Note: Add more rows as needed._


## Part 3 - Module Results

This section should be filled out at the end of the Sprint and submitted.

1. Put your GitHub link for your demonstration software here: https://github.com/cosmo4/GlassesInventoryPandas

2. Put your YouTube link for your code walkthrough and demo video here: https://youtu.be/wBSJDsTKJZk

3. Complete the following checklist by either indicating "Yes" or "No". If you indicate "No" then provide an explanation of why beneath the table.

|Question                                                    |Response|
|------------------------------------------------------------|--------|
|Are the links above public and working?                     |   Yes  |
|Did you complete all the unique requirements for the module?|  Yes   |
|Did you write at least 100 lines of code?                   |   No   |
|Did you fully complete the readme.md file?                  |   Yes  |
|Did you put the readme.md file in GitHub in the top folder? |   Yes  |

This Sprint I focused more about learning aspects and fixing issues I had with my dataset instead of writing a robust program. With the number of hours I spent getting it to work, I believe that I earned full credit and fulfilled all the requirements.

4. If you completed a Stretch Challenge (as shown in the Module Description document in Canvas) then describe what you did.  If you did the Choose Your Own Adventure module, then you get to decide what qualifies as a Stretch Challenge.

5. Did you change your selected module during the middle of the Sprint?  If yes, then describe what you changed it to, when you changed it, and why you changed it.

6. Using the log above, fill in the total hours and minutes you spent on the individual module:

|Activity         |Total Hours:Minutes|
|-----------------|-------------------|
|Individual Module|       10:30       |

7. What strategies (behavioral and technical) worked well during this Sprint?  What did not work well?  List some possible ways that you can improve next Sprint.

I found that sitting down and spending multiple hours on my project in a single day helped me stay focused and productive. There weren't good youtube video tutorials that I found to follow like I usually do, but the article tutorials helped me a lot.
