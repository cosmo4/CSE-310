# CSE 310 - Module Report

Name: Luke Warner

## Part 1 - Module Planning

This section should be filled on the first Monday of the Sprint and submitted

### Section 1.1 - Module Selection

1. What Sprint is this for (1-5)? 5

2. Select the Module (with a single X) that you will do this Sprint:

|Module                   |Selected Module|
|-------------------------|---------------|
|Cloud Databases          |               |
|Data Analysis            |               |
|Game Framework           |               |
|GIS Mapping              |               |
|Mobile App               |               |
|Networking               |               |
|SQL Relational Databases |               |
|Web Apps                 |               |
|C++                      |               |
|Java                     |               |
|Kotlin                   |               |
|Erlang                   |               |
|TypeScript               |               |
|Rust                     |       X       |
|Choose Your Own Adventure|               |

3. Find the list of unique requirements for your selected module in the Module Summary in Canvas.  In some circumstances, you will need to modify the requirements based on the technology or language you selected.  For the Choose Your Own Adventure, you need to create your own requirements.  List the unique module requirements below:

Write one or more programs in Rust that demonstrates some of the following:

* Variables (mutable and unumutable)

* Expressions

* Conditionals

* Loops

* Functions (ownership or reference)

Stretch Challenges (select one):

* Modify your program to use a data structure (e.g. Vec, LinkedList, Hashmap).

* Modify your program to use slicing.

* Modify your program to demonstrate object oriented techniques using both struct and impl.

### Section 1.2 - Planning

During the Sprint, you will spend 4 hours in class meetings, 4 hours on your team project (2 of which during class), and 10 hours on your selected module.  Make a plan for your 10 hours by answering the questions below.  You should refer back to this plan and make adjustments during the Sprint.

1. What sources have you selected to learn the technical material?

[Rust Programming](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started)
[Rust Tutorial - An Introduction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_KrYLW4jw8&t=1s)
[Using Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch01-03-hello-cargo.html)

2. What is your plan to practice the new material?  In other words, what is the order in which you plan to learn the material before working on your demonstration software?

I will focus on the articles and tutorials listed above for the first 5 hours of the sprint. I want to learn the software better before I try and make anything.

3. What demonstration software do you plan on submitting at the end of the Sprint (note that this can and may change)?

I have never used Rust, but I know I can write my code using VS Code so probably just an executable file.

4. Identify the days, times, and locations that you will work on the module.

I will work on this module on the days that I have class so it is fresh: Mon, Wed, Fri for 2 hours each of those days on my home computer.

5. Identify both a technical risk and a behavioral risk that you antcipate may occur during this Sprint.  What is your mitgigation plan?

I might have problems getting a working GUI, so I may just have to run something in the terminal. Using Rust is brand new for me so it is important that I take a lot of time learning about it.

## Part 2 - Time Log

This section should be filled out during the Sprint. 

Record all CSE 310 work that you do on your individual module or the team project.  Include time learning, practicing, developing, testing, and documenting.  Don't include time spent in the 4 class meetings (Planning, Stand-Up, Team Review, and Individual Review).  You will need to sum of these hours at the end of the Sprint. Note that the hours you report will affect your grades.

Note that `IM` stands for Individual Module and `TP` stands for Team Project.  

|Date      |Start Time|IM or TP|Description                                 |Hours:Minutes|
|----------|----------|--------|--------------------------------------------|-------------|
|   6/26   |  10:30   |   TP   | Enabled Google Cloud Vision API in project |    1:00     |
|   6/27   |   3:30   |   IM   | Started learning about Rust syntax         |    4:00     |
|   6/30   |   1:30   |   TP   | Upgraded Draw Window class, now saves img  |    4:00     |
|   7/1    |   4:30   |   TP   | Tinkering with Vision API                  |    1:15     |
|   7/1    |   4:00   |   IM   | Getting frustrated with scraping, giving up|    5:00     |
|   7/2    |   2:00   |   IM   | Going back to basics, made txt file reader |    2:00     |
|          |          |        |                                            |             |

_Note: Add more rows as needed._


## Part 3 - Module Results

This section should be filled out at the end of the Sprint and submitted.

1. Put your GitHub link for your demonstration software here: https://github.com/cosmo4/rust_demo

2. Put your YouTube link for your code walkthrough and demo video here: https://youtu.be/bUzEF5oRi2Q

3. Complete the following checklist by either indicating "Yes" or "No". If you indicate "No" then provide an explanation of why beneath the table.

|Question                                                    |Response|
|------------------------------------------------------------|--------|
|Are the links above public and working?                     |  Yes   |
|Did you complete all the unique requirements for the module?|  Yes   |
|Did you write at least 100 lines of code?                   |  Yes   |
|Did you fully complete the readme.md file?                  |  Yes   |
|Did you put the readme.md file in GitHub in the top folder? |  Yes   |

4. If you completed a Stretch Challenge (as shown in the Module Description document in Canvas) then describe what you did.  If you did the Choose Your Own Adventure module, then you get to decide what qualifies as a Stretch Challenge.

5. Did you change your selected module during the middle of the Sprint?  If yes, then describe what you changed it to, when you changed it, and why you changed it.

6. Using the log above, fill in the total hours and minutes you spent on the individual module:

|Activity         |Total Hours:Minutes|
|-----------------|-------------------|
|Individual Module|       11:00       |

7. What strategies (behavioral and technical) worked well during this Sprint?  What did not work well?  List some possible ways that you can improve next Sprint.

I think I over shot on my goal of making a web scraper in Rust. First off, I've never done that in any language and I thought it could be fun to learn how. I ran into quite a few problems though and ChatGPT couldn't help me figure it out. One thing that did work for me was learning all the basics of Rust. I found a lot of things to be transferrable from other languages, but there was a lot of new syntax and small things to remember.
