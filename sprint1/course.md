# CSE 310 - Module Report

Name: Luke Warner

## Part 1 - Module Planning

This section should be filled on the first Monday of the Sprint and submitted

### Section 1.1 - Module Selection

1. What Sprint is this for (1-5)? 1

2. Select the Module (with a single X) that you will do this Sprint:

|Module                   |Selected Module|
|-------------------------|---------------|
|Cloud Databases          |               |
|Data Analysis            |               |
|Game Framework           |       X       |
|GIS Mapping              |               |
|Mobile App               |               |
|Networking               |               |
|SQL Relational Databases |               |
|Web Apps                 |               |
|C++                      |               |
|Java                     |               |
|Kotlin                   |               |
|Erlang                   |               |
|TypeScript               |               |
|Rust                     |               |
|Choose Your Own Adventure|               |

3. Find the list of unique requirements for your selected module in the Module Summary in Canvas.  In some circumstances, you will need to modify the requirements based on the technology or language you selected.  For the Choose Your Own Adventure, you need to create your own requirements.  List the unique module requirements below:

Write a simple game using any game framework such as PyGame, Arcade (Python), Unity, or GoDot. You can also create your own by using graphics packages like OpenGL or Raylib.

The game must have the following characteristics:

* The game must display graphics
* The game must take user input from the keyboard or mouse
* The game must have moveable objects

Stretch Challenges (select one):

* Allow the user to save and load the game.
* Add music or sound effects to the game.
* Provide levels in your game that change the difficulty of the game.

### Section 1.2 - Planning

During the Sprint, you will spend 4 hours in class meetings, 4 hours on your team project (2 of which during class), and 10 hours on your selected module.  Make a plan for your 10 hours by answering the questions below.  You should refer back to this plan and make adjustments during the Sprint.

1. What sources have you selected to learn the technical material?

I am going to be using the Unity game engine to help me create my game. The documentation will be helpful https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/index.html. 

2. What is your plan to practice the new material?  In other words, what is the order in which you plan to learn the material before working on your demonstration software?

* Day 1 (Mon): Familiarize myself with the Unity interface and basic concepts.
* Day 2 (Wed): Learn about creating and manipulating game objects in Unity.
* Day 3 (Fri): Understand user input handling in Unity, including keyboard and mouse input.
* Day 4 (Mon): Implement basic graphics rendering and movement for game objects.
* Day 5 (Wed): Work on integrating user input with object movement and interaction.
* Day 6 (Fri): Experiment with adding additional features like sound effects or multiple levels. 

3. What demonstration software do you plan on submitting at the end of the Sprint (note that this can and may change)?

Plan to submit a simple game prototype built in Unity that meets the requirements outlined, including displaying graphics, taking user input, and having moveable objects. Stretch challenges may be attempted depending on progress.

4. Identify the days, times, and locations that you will work on the module.

I will work on this module on the days that I have class so it is fresh: Mon, Wed, Fri for 2 hours each of those days on my home computer.

5. Identify both a technical risk and a behavioral risk that you antcipate may occur during this Sprint.  What is your mitgigation plan?

Set clear daily goals and deadlines, use time management techniques like the Pomodoro method, and regularly assess progress to stay on track.


## Part 2 - Time Log

This section should be filled out during the Sprint. 

Record all CSE 310 work that you do on your individual module or the team project.  Include time learning, practicing, developing, testing, and documenting.  Don't include time spent in the 4 class meetings (Planning, Stand-Up, Team Review, and Individual Review).  You will need to sum of these hours at the end of the Sprint. Note that the hours you report will affect your grades.

Note that `IM` stands for Individual Module and `TP` stands for Team Project.

_Note: Add more rows as needed._


## Part 3 - Module Results

This section should be filled out at the end of the Sprint and submitted.

1. Put your GitHub link for your demonstration software here: https://simmer.io/@cosmo4/flappy-pig The Unity project folder was huge and I had trouble uploading everything to github. I included all my C# coding files in the github repo. I used Simmer to upload my game so you can play it if you like. 
https://github.com/cosmo4/CSE-310/tree/main/sprint1/flappy-pig

2. Put your YouTube link for your code walkthrough and demo video here: https://youtu.be/TrGZsUKjURM

3. Complete the following checklist by either indicating "Yes" or "No". If you indicate "No" then provide an explanation of why beneath the table.

|Question                                                    |Response|
|------------------------------------------------------------|--------|
|Are the links above public and working?                     |  yes   |
|Did you complete all the unique requirements for the module?|  yes   |
|Did you write at least 100 lines of code?                   |  yes   |
|Did you fully complete the readme.md file?                  |  yes   |
|Did you put the readme.md file in GitHub in the top folder? |  yes   |

4. If you completed a Stretch Challenge (as shown in the Module Description document in Canvas) then describe what you did.  If you did the Choose Your Own Adventure module, then you get to decide what qualifies as a Stretch Challenge.

I added sound effects to my game: jumping, getting a point, and dying all have their own sounds.

5. Did you change your selected module during the middle of the Sprint?  If yes, then describe what you changed it to, when you changed it, and why you changed it.

No

6. Using the log above, fill in the total hours and minutes you spent on the individual module:

|Activity         |Total Hours:Minutes|
|-----------------|-------------------|
|Individual Module|       13:30        |

7. What strategies (behavioral and technical) worked well during this Sprint?  What did not work well?  List some possible ways that you can improve next Sprint.

Sitting down for long periods of time was extremely helpful. I was able to stay focused and get a lot done in those times that I spent more than 1 hour at a time. I also finished the project well before the due date with was great. For next Sprint, I am going to start earlier so I can add more features and functionality.
