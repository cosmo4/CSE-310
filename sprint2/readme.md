## Overview

**Project Title**: Bank App

**Project Description**: This app will be my own version of BANK!, a dice game played by 3 or more people. Different values will add a bank score until a 7 is rolled, then the bank goes back down to 0. At any time a player can yell 'Bank' and whatever amount is in the bank adds to your current score.

**Project Goals**: I have never made a mobile app, and I want to learn how I can make this and publish it on Google Play Store and the Apple App Store.
