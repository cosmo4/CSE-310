# CSE 310 - Module Report

Name: Luke Warner

## Part 1 - Module Planning

This section should be filled on the first Monday of the Sprint and submitted

### Section 1.1 - Module Selection

1. What Sprint is this for (1-5)? 2

2. Select the Module (with a single X) that you will do this Sprint:

|Module                   |Selected Module|
|-------------------------|---------------|
|Cloud Databases          |               |
|Data Analysis            |               |
|Game Framework           |               |
|GIS Mapping              |               |
|Mobile App               |       X       |
|Networking               |               |
|SQL Relational Databases |               |
|Web Apps                 |               |
|C++                      |               |
|Java                     |               |
|Kotlin                   |               |
|Erlang                   |               |
|TypeScript               |               |
|Rust                     |               |
|Choose Your Own Adventure|               |

3. Find the list of unique requirements for your selected module in the Module Summary in Canvas.  In some circumstances, you will need to modify the requirements based on the technology or language you selected.  For the Choose Your Own Adventure, you need to create your own requirements.  List the unique module requirements below:

Create a Mobile App using one of the following platforms:

* Android - Java or Kotlin
* iOS - Swift - Note that you need a Mac using XCode for this option
* React Native - Javascript - Creates Android/iOS compatible apps
* Flutter/Dart - Creates Web/Android/iOS compatible apps

The app must have the following characteristics:

* Have at least one screen
* Be interactive with the user (e.g. responds to inputs by displaying appropriate outputs)

Stretch Challenges (select one):

* Integrate with a component on the phone such as the camera, microphone, sensor, or location services.
* Incorporate two or more screens
* Store data either in local storage so is persists even if the app closes or if the phone is turned off

### Section 1.2 - Planning

During the Sprint, you will spend 4 hours in class meetings, 4 hours on your team project (2 of which during class), and 10 hours on your selected module.  Make a plan for your 10 hours by answering the questions below.  You should refer back to this plan and make adjustments during the Sprint.

1. What sources have you selected to learn the technical material?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_DyOJJxuMI (How to make and publish an app in the google play store)
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvp7wvbyceo Xamarin Tutorial

2. What is your plan to practice the new material?  In other words, what is the order in which you plan to learn the material before working on your demonstration software?

First I will research my options for a dev environment. I will look at Xamarin, Flutter, and React Native and decide which one will be the best for my project. Once chosen, I will watch more tutorial videos and code along with them to help develop my skills and understanding.

3. What demonstration software do you plan on submitting at the end of the Sprint (note that this can and may change)?

I will hopefully be able to submit a link to the Google Play store and the App store.

4. Identify the days, times, and locations that you will work on the module.

I will work on this module on the days that I have class so it is fresh: Mon, Wed, Fri for 2 hours each of those days on my home computer.

5. Identify both a technical risk and a behavioral risk that you antcipate may occur during this Sprint.  What is your mitgigation plan?

It's possible I am unable to publish the app to any app store and I might need to turn in an sdk file instead. I will make sure that the library or framework I choose will allow me to do that.


## Part 2 - Time Log

This section should be filled out during the Sprint. 

Record all CSE 310 work that you do on your individual module or the team project.  Include time learning, practicing, developing, testing, and documenting.  Don't include time spent in the 4 class meetings (Planning, Stand-Up, Team Review, and Individual Review).  You will need to sum of these hours at the end of the Sprint. Note that the hours you report will affect your grades.

Note that `IM` stands for Individual Module and `TP` stands for Team Project.

1. Put your GitHub link for your demonstration software here: 

2. Put your YouTube link for your code walkthrough and demo video here:

3. Complete the following checklist by either indicating "Yes" or "No". If you indicate "No" then provide an explanation of why beneath the table.

|Question                                                    |Response|

|Did you put the readme.md file in GitHub in the top folder? |        |

4. If you completed a Stretch Challenge (as shown in the Module Description document in Canvas) then describe what you did.  If you did the Choose Your Own Adventure module, then you get to decide what qualifies as a Stretch Challenge.

5. Did you change your selected module during the middle of the Sprint?  If yes, then describe what you changed it to, when you changed it, and why you changed it.

6. Using the log above, fill in the total hours and minutes you spent on the individual module:
